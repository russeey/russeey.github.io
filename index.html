                Hello, Love
            </p>

        I hope you find this message well. Anyways, I hope you will wholeheartedly accept this gift. It might make you wonder why I gave you a stuffed cat. It's because when you mentioned being in deep trauma with a cat due to what it did to you, I really want you to know that acknowledging things that may hurt you will help you grow. I hope this stuffed cat can be a reminder to maintain a mindful mindset and break the odds about everything you fear.

As for the flowers, it was really random when I selected them. Despite the many flowers I wanted to give you, I chose this crochet flower because it's the only one I know that can't die. I'm putting myself into it, promising that as these flowers continue to bloom with their colors, I'll be here for you. You might wonder why I said "continue to bloom" even though it's not real. It's because, as this flower blooms in your hands. So am I to you. I hope this flower reminds you of me. That despite the period of time, there's always something in me that is now in you.

Please promise me, love, whatever may lie ahead, keep them for me. It might feel awkward to please you with these things, but I truly want to see them taking place on you.

    And as for this part, I've already edited this message. I know things aren't the same between us, but I want you to know that I'm keeping my word as I've said in this message. I'll still keep things between us, and I'll always be here for you. Sadly, I felt that we weren't nurtured by time, and the connection and effort fell out in a place where we couldn't catch up. But maybe this is just a part of building a foundation for our future. I hope the future still holds you for me. I admire you so much, even though everything is not the same. I will always look up to you because you're the one who gave me so much, the one who gave me the love that I truly deserve. Unfortunately, this timing is not as I expected. But I pray and hope that one day, everything between us will be back in its place. I hope that day both of us will be ready to beat the odds of time and give our relationship a chance as we expect. I miss you, and I love you so much, Zelle. Please take care of yourself always.
